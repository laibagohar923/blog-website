            Yes, TheVehicleVin Canada is legitimate, as officially announced in
            a press release in 2020. The service, an extension of
            TheVehicleVin.com serving the U.S. since 2012, provides an
            affordable option for Canadians to access comprehensive vehicle
            history reports. Users can check a VIN registered in Canada and
            receive detailed reports, including matching registration records,
            salvage records, theft records, buyback records, and a bonus U.S.
            history report. TheVehicleVin has a proven track record,
            distributing over 10 million vehicle history reports in the U.S. at
            a fraction of the cost compared to similar reports from Carfax.

          TheVehicleVin.ca offers a cost-effective alternative to Carfax,
            with a comprehensive vehicle history report priced at one-third or
            $29 less. TheVehicleVin is recommended for those prioritizing
            vehicle registration, status, and odometer readings, while Carfax
            may be preferable for in-depth accident and service records. For
            cost-efficient screening of a large number of cars, using both
            TheVehicleVin and Carfax reports is suggested. TheVehicleVin can be
            employed for initial pre-screening, and Carfax can be utilized for
            detailed validation of top choices.

          TheVehicleVin Canada is a comprehensive VIN check service
            specifically designed for Canadian-registered vehicles. It provides
            a VIN search to generate a detailed report on the history of a
            vehicle and even US historical records if available. While a VIN
            decoder provides basic information about a vehicle, TheVehicleVin
            Canada goes further by offering full car history reports. These
            reports include crucial details such as title history, accident
            records, odometer readings, and more, making it a more comprehensive
            tool for assessing the overall history and condition of a vehicle.
